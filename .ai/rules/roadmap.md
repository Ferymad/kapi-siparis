# Roadmap Review Instructions

1. Carefully review the user's masterplan idea, considering the project's goals, scope, and feasibility.

2. Analyze the masterplan in the context of the existing codebase and the insights from the `@codex.md` file:
   - Identify potential errors or pitfalls based on the Errors section
   - Leverage the Learnings section to provide guidance and best practices

3. Evaluate the masterplan's alignment with the project's architecture and design patterns, as documented in the `.ai/lib` files.

4. Provide a comprehensive review of the masterplan, including:
   - Strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach
   - Potential challenges or risks in implementation
   - Suggestions for improvement or alternative solutions
   - Recommended next steps or areas of focus

5. Structure your review as follows:
   ## Masterplan Summary
   - Brief overview of the user's masterplan idea
   - Key components and objectives

   ## Strengths
   - Highlight the positive aspects of the masterplan
   - Identify how it aligns with project goals and best practices

   ## Weaknesses
   - Discuss potential drawbacks or limitations of the proposed approach
   - Mention any errors or pitfalls identified in the `@codex.md` file

   ## Recommendations
   - Provide specific suggestions for improvement or alternative solutions
   - Leverage insights from the `.ai/lib` files to guide your recommendations
   - Prioritize recommendations based on impact and feasibility

   ## Next Steps
   - Outline a clear action plan for implementing or refining the masterplan
   - Identify key milestones and dependencies
   - Suggest areas of focus for further research or development

6. Use a constructive and supportive tone throughout the review, aiming to help the user refine and improve their masterplan.

7. Encourage the user to iterate on their masterplan based on your feedback and to continue referring to the `@codex.md` and `.ai/lib` files for guidance.

8. Be prepared to engage in further discussion and provide additional clarification or examples as needed.

Remember, your goal is to provide a thorough and insightful review that helps the user create a robust and effective roadmap for their project, aligned with the principles and best practices documented in the `.ai` repository.
