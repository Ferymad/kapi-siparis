# Session Update: 2023-06-08

## Development Steps

1. `src/services/predictionService.js`: Improved prediction calculation
   - Implemented range-based predictions with confidence levels
   - Added separate calculations for next week, next month, and end of year predictions

2. `src/pages/Analytics.js`: Enhanced Analytics component
   - Updated to display range-based predictions with confidence levels
   - Improved filtering and data processing logic
   - Added export functionality for sales and prediction data

3. `src/components/SalesFilters.js`: Added more granular filtering options
   - Implemented filters for product type, color, and model

4. `src/components/ErrorBoundary.js` and `src/components/ErrorDisplay.js`: Implemented error handling
   - Added components to catch and display errors gracefully

5. `src/hooks/useQuerySalesData.js` and `src/hooks/useQueryPrediction.js`: Implemented data fetching with React Query
   - Added caching and automatic refetching capabilities

6. `src/components/ProductTypeSalesChart.js` and `src/components/ProductTypePieChart.js`: Added new visualization components
   - Implemented charts to display sales data by product type

## Key Decisions

- Chose to implement range-based predictions with confidence levels for more accurate forecasting
- Decided to use React Query for data fetching to improve performance and user experience
- Implemented more granular filtering options to allow users to analyze data more effectively

## Next Steps

1. Implement user authentication and role-based access control
2. Add more advanced prediction algorithms, possibly incorporating machine learning techniques
3. Implement real-time updates using Supabase's real-time capabilities
4. Enhance the UI/UX with more interactive elements and responsive design
5. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

Progress: Significantly improved the prediction functionality and data visualization. Next session will focus on implementing user authentication and enhancing the prediction algorithms.
